# Weather-application
Dynamic weather application using CSS, HTML, JS.
In this web application I have used the api for fetching the data.

STEPS:
--download the project
--open it in visual studio code.
--open with live server you will see the web application running in your browser.
--enter the name of the city for which you want to check the weather details in the serach bar of the weather application you can see      the required info displayed on the screen.
